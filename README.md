# Westside-Wins
West Side Winnings App — Full Description

West Side Winnings is a Bay-Area-themed online casino arcade built as a mobile-first web app.
It recreates the corner-store, hyphy-era vibe of Santa Clara with animated slot games, sound effects, and local culture references.

Core Concept

A single-page experience where players tap into Mac Dre-style slots, Santa Clara Spins, and future titles like Woodie.
Each game has its own music, artwork, and animation. The app focuses on entertainment, not gambling with real money.
